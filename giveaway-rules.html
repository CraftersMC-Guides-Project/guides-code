      <h1>Giveaway Rules</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Only join if you can claim your prize.</li>
        <li>
          Hosts only and can choose to cancel or reroll the giveaway if you
          don’t claim your prize.
        </li>
        <li>
          You cannot claim from friends or alt accounts/profiles, only from
          which you joined the giveaway.
        </li>
        <li>
          Joining without claiming 3-4 times in a row may result in being
          removed from future giveaways.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don’t claim within the specified time, the giveaway will be
          rerolled, and hosts can set the next timing based on the rerolls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users facing real-life issues will be given extra time to claim their
          prizes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Winners can only claim from their original profiles (the first one you
          created that is still in existence).
        </li>
        <li>
          Sponsors may take time to reward you, winners can contact admins if
          the host is not replying from a long period of time (i.e. 24-48h+).
        </li>
        <li>
          Winners cannot ask sponsors to give their rewards to others; the prize
          will be rerolled or canceled instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Winners have the right to report sponsors for any scams; so speak for
          yourself to the admins.
        </li>
        <li>If the giveaway has issues, admins can restart the giveaway.</li>
        <li>
          Begging winners or host for prizes may lead to disqualification from
          future giveaways.
