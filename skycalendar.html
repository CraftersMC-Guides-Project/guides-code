<!--Plan: 
make a mockup of the craftersmc calendar ingame, as a website
use a system to calculate each day and it can be infinitely calculated,
each page is 31 days, so page 1 is day 1-31, page 2 is day 32-62, etc
it will calcuate the first 2 pages on load,
a button to go to the next page, onlick it will replace the current page with the next pages
the button will also calculate the next pages, so if you are on page 2, it wll callculate page 3,
page 5, calculate page 6
page 10, calculate page 11
etc
Underneath that calendar, it will show the next upcoming events with timers, like the first page before the json UI calendar ingame
It will show the next upcoming event for each event
Then we will have underneath that the same timer and next 10 calculations as we have already, all in one page. 
This is gonna be hugeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
anyways i have the new covid variant so im going to sleep bye
