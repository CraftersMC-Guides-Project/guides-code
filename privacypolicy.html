    <h1>CraftersMC AI:</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>1. Prompts</h2>
        <p>
            CraftersMC AI is a separate service that uses an open-source AI on together-ai, which has been modified to create our own AI model. None of us (together-ai and craftersmc guides) store this. All that happens is we send your prompt to our <b>own API</b>, then after processing <b>and anonymizing</b> your prompt we send it to together.ai, which sends it to our custom model there to provide AI-generated responses. It does not collect or store any personal information from users. The AI does not have access to your Discord or Xbox usernames, and it does not track user activity. Prompts are deleted after processing, and no user data is stored or used for training purposes.
        </p><br>
        <h2>2. Responses</h2>
        <p>
            The AI is designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality. It does not retain conversations or use them for training purposes. All interactions with the AI are processed in real-time and are not stored. All our training data is from the CraftersMC Wiki, which is publicly available, or from the CraftersMC Guides team, which is our own brains. The AI does not have access to any private data or personal information about users.
