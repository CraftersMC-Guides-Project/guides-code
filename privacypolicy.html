        <h2 class="pp-h2">2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p class="pp-p">
            We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information such as your real name, address, or phone number for
            analytics or tracking purposes. We do <strong>not</strong> track user activity or use certain analytics
            tools that link data to you to gather browsing data. We use a privacy-focused analytics tool that does not
            collect personal data or track individual users. This means we do not store or analyze your browsing
            history, search queries, or any other personal information that could identify you. This is used to track
            how many visits we get, what devices are used, and what pages are visited. We do not use this data to create
            user profiles or track individual behavior across the site. <b>None of this data is linked to you</b>

            We use <strong>cookies</strong> to store your login session and user preferences securely in your browser.
            This is required for authentication and to provide a personalized experience. We also use
            <strong>localStorage</strong> to remember your preferences. This data is stored on your device and is never
            shared with third parties by us. <b>All cookie data is deleted every 7 days.</b>

        <h2 class="pp-h2">1. Prompts</h2>
        <p class="pp-p">
            CraftersMC AI is a separate service that uses an open-source AI on together-ai, which has been modified to
            create our own AI model. None of us (together-ai and craftersmc guides) store this. All that happens is we
            send your prompt to our <b>own API</b>, then after processing <b>and anonymizing</b> your prompt we send it
            to together.ai, which sends it to our custom model there to provide AI-generated responses. It does not
            collect or store any personal information from users. The AI does not have access to your Discord or Xbox
            usernames, and it does not track user activity. Prompts are deleted after processing, and no user data is
            stored or used for training purposes.
        </p><br>
        <h2 class="pp-h2">2. Responses</h2>
        <p class="pp-p">
            The AI is designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality. It does not retain conversations or use them
            for training purposes. All interactions with the AI are processed in real-time and are not stored. All our
            training data is from the CraftersMC Wiki, which is publicly available, or from the CraftersMC Guides team,
            which is our own brains. The AI does not have access to any private data or personal information about
            users.
